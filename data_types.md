# Data Types
Rust is a statically typed and explicitly language. Although the compiler can infer what type an unlabeled variable is, it's best to always label your variables to avoid future confusion. I actually couldn't find any information on if Rust is strongly typed or weakly typed.<br>
Download the [data_types.rs](exercises/1_data_types.rs) exercise or create your own code based on the tutorial below. 
## Keywords
Rust has numerous strict keywords that cannot be used to name variables or attributes. Included in this list are `if`, `loop`, `self`, and `true`, which are all words used in frequently in programming. According to the [Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), there are 52 total reserved words.
## Scalar types
### Integers
To create an integer, first determine if the variable will be signed (depicted with an `i`) or unsigned (`u`). Then, choose the number of bits (`8`, `16`, `32`, `64`, or `128`). Rust also allows you to use `size` instead of a number of bits, which will either be a 32-bit  or 64-bit integer based on your computer's architecture.<br>
You can also use hex, octal, and binary integers, by using an appropriate prefix for the variable declaration (see below).
```
let x: u8 = 4; // 8 bit, non-negative integer
// If explicit typing excluded, Rust defaults to creating an i32 int 
let hex = 0x04 // Use 0x for hex
let octal = 0o04 // Use 0o for octal
let binary =  0b0100 // Use 0b for binary
```
### Floats
Floats are defined similarly to integers, using either `f32` or `f64` to create a 32 or 64-bit signed float. By default, 64 bits are used.
Integers and floats share operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder.  To perform division with a remainder, the divisor must be a float.
```
let add = 1 + 2;
let sub = 3.0 - 1.0;
let mult = 2 * 3;
let div = 10 / 3; // Will return 3
let div2 = 10.0 / 3.0 // Will return 3.33...
let rem = 10 / 3 // Will return 1
```

## Mutability
By default, every variable is immutable upon creation. If you want to create a variable that can be changed, add a `mut` before the variable declaration. It's recommended to avoid using `mut` unless necessary for the program.
```
let x: i32 = 5;
x = 3; // This will throw an error, as x is immutable

let y: i32 = 5;
y = 5 // Since y is mutable, no error occurs 
```
Constants also exist in Rust, creating using the `const` keyword. Constants can never be mutable and must be type annotated. They can be accessed globally.
